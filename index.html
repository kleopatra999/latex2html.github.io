    <h1>LaTeX2HTML</h1>
    <p>LaTeX2HTML is a utility that converts LaTeX documents to web pages in HTML.</p>

    The LaTeX2HTML translator:
<ul>
    <li>breaks up a document into one or more components as specified by the user,
    <li>provides optional iconic navigation panels on every page which contain links to other parts of the document,
    <li>handles inlined equations, right-justified numbered equations, tables, or figures and any arbitrary environment,
    <li>can produce output suitable for browsers that support inlined images or character based browsers (as specified by the user),
    <li>handles definitions of new commands, environments, and theorems even when these are defined in external style files,
    <li>handles footnotes, tables of contents, lists of figures and tables, bibliographies, and can generate an Index,
    <li>translates cross-references into hyperlinks and extends the LaTeX cross-referencing mechanism to work not just within a document but between documents which may reside in remote locations,
    <li>translates accent and special character commands to the equivalent ISO-LATIN-1 character set where possible,
    <li>recognizes hypertext links (to multimedia resources or arbitrary internet services such as sound/video/ftp/http/news) and links which invoke arbitrary program scripts, all expressed as LaTeX commands,
    <li>recognizes conditional text which is intended only for the hypertext version, or only for the paper (DVI) version,
    <li>can include raw HTML in a LaTeX document (e.g. in order to specify interactive forms),
    <li>can deal sensibly with all the commands and environments commonly used with LaTeX as summarized at the back of the LaTeX blue book, and many of the packages described in the LaTeX Companion, and others.
    <li>will try to translate any document with embedded LaTeX commands irrespective of whether it is complete or syntactically legal.
    </ul>
